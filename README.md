# Automatic Target Recognition using SAR Imagery

## Abstract
One of the most important tasks in the image analysis is the classification as we use 
the labels from the image data and transform it into real-world word information. In 
this study, we have worked on achieving the task of classification on the real-world 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imagery. The simple optical images are not that 
useful at night times and when there is a lot of cloud coverage in the atmosphere 
which makes it imperative that we deal with the SAR data for gathering information. 
This task is quite important as the SAR images are not like the optical images in 
which we can see and identify the object using our eyes, so that is why we need 
computers so we can know exactly what kind of objects are present with high 
accuracy and efficiency. Our task has majorly been to find what type of target is in 
the image which is the classification part as well as finding the target exactly where 
it is in the whole image which is the identification part. Our solution is composed of 
using a deep neural network to get rid of the unnecessary clutter and get the most 
important features. This solution can be used on any kind of data which would be 
available so it is a framework which can work on the SAR data and help us find the 
targets with high accuracy.

## Objectives
* Getting the information about the enemy territory and its vehicle 
positioning. 
* Help the security institutions to correctly identify the type of targets 
from the satellite data.
* Identifying where the target is in the current terrain is. 
* Analyzing a more efficient and higher accuracy method for 
classification.

## Methodology
### Data Acquisition - MSTAR
The Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Identification (MSTAR) Program is 
a collaborative initiative between the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Organization (DARPA) and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) to develop and 
test the advanced ATR system.' The program started in June 1995 and would conclude 
at the conclude of 1999. The curriculum stressed the need to tackle extended operational 
situations (EOCs), i.e. situations that vary from all those found in the training data 
available and focused heavily upon model-based (CAD and Bayesian) technologies. 
The MSTAR software performed systematic assessments of the efficiency of the 
network every fall (1996, 1997, and 1998). The evaluation of ATR is an essential 
foundation for technical and algorithmic decision-making. Analytical judgments may 
include. The selection among two various options to some subsystem or the recognition 
of weak links inside the system. Programming decisions may entail competitive down-selects 
or innovations transformations to users. Assessment of any kind. The "trained" 
system has its challenges, but the evaluation of ATRs seems to be particularly 
problematic due to limitations. Accessible data are relative to the magnitude of the issue. 
The dataset has 8 targets with multiple angles and each angle contain around 49 images.

### Model Architecture
The model which has been finalized to be used for the classifications is YOLOv3. The 
major reason behind using this algorithm is that not only it detects what type of target 
is in the image, it also detects and identifies where the target exists by enclosing it into 
a box which is quite an important thing in the SAR ATR. It helps in the real-time 
detection of the targets inside continuous video-based SAR imagery as well as images 
with a huge background. This is a step further than just classifying what is in a picture 
or the frame.
YOLO used the convolution layers which makes it a full convolution network (FCN). 
The underlying architecture is called the Darknet-53, which is the feature extractor, it
contains 53 convolution layers which is followed by the batch normalization layer each 
as well as Leaky activation. There is not sort of pooling being incorporated in this and 
stride 2 convolutions is used which downsamples the features.

### MVP Architecture

Our project uses a Model-View-Presenter (MVP) approach for its system. It is a 
derivation of the Model-View-Controller approach. MVP comprises of three 
components Model, View and Presenter

### Image Detection
This is the main feature of the systems which takes the input of the SAR image and 
identify the targets and classify them very quickly. This shows the Browse image option 
after which we can use the detect image to find the targets.

### Video Detection

The video detection works the same way the image detection work and gets the input 
from the file directory you use and give the output with an actual video which shows 
the target being highlighted and even the moving target is a also identified with constant 
highlighting the target which is the key part in real-time classification.

## Conclusion and Future Work
TerraSAR is Pakistanâ€™s first software for real-time target detection of SAR images. The 
system is designed to detect ground military vehicles especially during nighttime and 
bad weather conditions. YOLO architecture has been implemented in our system which 
provides better real-time target detection as compared to the competitive algorithms of 
FASTER R-CNN and SSD. We have trained our model on publicly available MSTAR 
dataset. TerraSAR will help defence institutions to correctly identify the type of targets 
and location of targets in the current terrain using satellite data. Our research and 
provided solution solve the problem of target detection for military and defence 
purposes that cannot be done through traditional optical satellites. 
TerraSAR provides an accuracy of 97-99% by using YOLO architecture. Our future 
work includes:

* Using a larger set of datasets to reduce overfitting 
* Making a database of more images to avoid data augmentation
* Original dataset (provided by defence institutions) can be used to train and 
generalize our model to provide better accuracy.
